# Shiny practice - Monty Hall Paradox

### About the practice

This repository contains the Shiny practice from Data Visualization Techniques topic proposed by Alejandro Vidal, teacher at CUNEF University. 

### What is the Monty Hall problem?

The Monty Hall paradox is a famous puzzle from an American game show. It goes like this: you are presented with 3 doors. Behind two are goats and behind the third is a car or a large prize. You are asked to select a door; if you select the door with the car, you win! After selecting, the host then opens one of the remaining two doors, revealing a goat. The host then asks if you would like to switch doors or stay with your original choice. The debate is there.
